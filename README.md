### Overview
I utilized the dataset from class using teachable machine. There are over 40k images in the dataset. Each image is a 224x224 pixel RGB scale, categorized into one of three classes: "Class 1: Touch," "Class 2: No hands," and "Class 3: No Touch w/ Hands.‚Äù
The dataset contains over 40k images. I decided to take good quality 20k images after cleaning then I allocated  80% of the images for training, and 20% for validation.

### CNN Architecture

- First part of the convolutional layer using batch normalization, dropout, and max-pooling and ReLu nonlinearity which only exist in these layers
- After the convolutional layers, the network approach the fully connected layer that has ReLU and batch normalization and dropout.
- Finally, the network is followed by the feedforward and computes the the scores and softmax probability. I also included L2 regulation in the built-in implementation.
